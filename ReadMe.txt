This app acts is designed to simulate job allocation across shifts and machines.  Within the attached database, there are four fields: the specKey, the job title, the printer information, and the display information.

For simplicity, each job is represented by a letter.  The printer will 'print' the lowercase form of the letter, and the screen will display the uppercase form followed by the lowercase from.  So, for the job 'G', the printer will print 'g', and the screen will display 'Gg'.  A job may be removed from the job list by selecting it, and pressing the Delete button.

The user may select up to ten jobs to be run during a given cycle.  The user will also choose between two and five shifts and up to five active machines.

The simulation will run if the user presses the Run button, and each of the input parameters is acceptable.

At the time of inclusion, the TextileSpecs database does not automatically connect.  This can be rectified by placing the location of the TextileSpecs.mdf file included in this download into the address bar across the bottom of the app.
